## My process
Using CSS preprocessor SCSS for styling was better for me. I broke each part of the project into components so I can style each component separately in their respective files. Using SCSS made me come to terms with the use and importance of the command line and NPM. It was worthwhile learning something new. I used max-width to for the project such that, either desktop or mobile, it looks the same.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS (SASS)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learned how to use forEach loop. I also learn how to commit to github in using the command line in visual studio code.

### Continued development

I would like to get more of SCSS and JS. There's more in JS that I need to know.
